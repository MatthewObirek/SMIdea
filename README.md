# This Project is an Attempt To build my Own Social Media Idea - Hence SMIdea
The abstract goal for this idea is to encourage users to engage with content through the socratic method. The algorithm used is listed below

# Attempt to Implement the Socratic Method into an Algorithm

### The Socratic Method
1. Questioning: Socrates used a series of probing questions to challenge his conversation partner's beliefs and encourage them to think more deeply about a subject.

1. Irony: Socrates often pretended ignorance to draw out his interlocutors' assumptions and expose contradictions in their arguments.

2. Elenchus (Cross-examination): This is a method of questioning aimed at exposing contradictions or inconsistencies in an interlocutor's beliefs or arguments.

3. Inductive Reasoning: Socrates used examples and specific cases to arrive at general principles or definitions.

4. Refutation: Socrates aimed to demonstrate that his interlocutors' beliefs were flawed or lacked a solid foundation, leading them to question and revise their views.

6. Maieutics (Midwifery): Socrates saw himself as a "midwife" to ideas, helping others give birth to their own understanding by asking leading questions.

### The Algorithm Identified --Incomplete

1. Input - User input of Idea, Topic, Question, or statement.

2. Initialize Knowledge Base:
    a. State Assumptions about topic
    b. State Logical Argument about Topic supporting ideas presented
    c. Cite Support from other Arguments that can apply.

3. The Qualitative Analysis.

    a. Open-Ended Questions
        i. Select Identified supporting Question
            1. *** Issue With Asking Non-Substantial Questions (eg. "Why is this Soooo good?") *** - turn into feature, not bug - (make it a share function, not a Analysis Question, use sentiment analysis to recommend sharing/commenting over debate with this comment.)
            2. *** Issue With Asking Off-Topic Questions (eg. topic: Advancements in green fuel, "Why dont people just use electric trains instead?") *** - Sentiment analysis to see if off topic, if true recommend restructure of question to align closer to topic.
        ii. Answer/ Pose Question to KnowledgeBase - within question, one can bring their own suspected answer - citing from other arguments 
      
    b. Response
        i.Evaluate
            1. *** Issue With How to Determine a Quality Response?*** - maybe voting (like reddit)/ or voting on specific segments of an argument.


    c. Update Knowledge Base
    d. Generate Follow-up Questions
    e. 

a. Ask Open-ended Question:

Select a question from the knowledge base.
Pose the question to the knowledge base or the interlocutor.
b. Evaluate Response:

Analyze the response for coherence and consistency with known facts and assumptions.
Identify any potential contradictions or gaps in reasoning.
c. Update Knowledge Base:

Incorporate new information gained from the response into the knowledge base.
Revise or refine known facts or assumptions as needed.
d. Generate Follow-up Questions:

Based on the response, generate additional questions to further probe and clarify.
e. Check for Convergence or Divergence:

Determine if the inquiry is converging towards a logical and factual truth or if there are persistent inconsistencies.
f. Repeat Loop:
